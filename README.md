Pawsfind is a map-based lost/found pet reporting system, which users can quickly log-in with Google Login API, and create reports for the pets they lost or found, using a website with a  streamlined user interface, enabling users to find their pets as quick and efficiently as possible. 
If the pet of a user goes missing, they can report them as lost, with their name, a picture of them, the location they went missing and tags and description, which may include discriminating details and gender of their pet, potential reward and contact information.
If a user finds a potentially lost pet, they can report them as a found pet similar to reporting lost pets. This enables users to quickly find their pets back, or help other people find their pets. Found reports help lost pet users to narrow down the search location, if their pet was found somewhere. Additionally, users can filter the results with tags such as ”dog”, ”orange” and ”budgie”, time such as ”3 days ago” and by found/lost reports.
This project uses Google Maps API.
